# 05-02-challenge

## Description

This was a daily planner for the current day and stores the data locally in the local storage of web browser. This site was made using JQuery and Moment.js. This solves the problem of setting daily planner for an individual for the current day. I learned how to go through JQuery and how to go through the DOM tree using it.
